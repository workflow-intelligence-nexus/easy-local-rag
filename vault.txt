US President Joe Biden has praised American forces who he said "helped Israel take down nearly all" the drones and missiles launched by Iran on Sunday .In a statement, he said the US had moved aircraft and warships to the region before the unprecedented attack."I condemn these attacks in the strongest possible terms," he added.Israel said Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles in its direction, the first time it has attacked Israel directly from its own territory .It said the "vast majority" were intercepted, but there were a small number of hits including at an IDF base in southern Israel.At least one person, reported to be a young girl, was injured.Iran earlier warned that Israel would be "punished" for a strike on its consulate in Syria on 1 April, which killed seven Iranian officers including a top commander .Israel has not confirmed or denied whether it was responsible.

"I've just spoken with Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu to reaffirm America's ironclad commitment to the security of Israel," Mr Biden said shortly after the pair held a call. "I told him that Israel demonstrated a remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attacks," he added.● LIVE UPDA TES: Iran launches drones at Israel in retaliatory attacks ● Iran launches aerial attack on Israel in major escalation Mr Biden also said he plans to convene G7 leaders on Sunday "to co-ordinate a united diplomatic response to Iran's brazen attack".He warned Iran against attacking any US assets, adding while Iran has not done so, America "remains vigilant to all threats".President Biden cut short a planned visit to his home state of Delaware on Saturday , travelling back to the White House to be briefed by national security officials hours before the attack.

White House National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said Mr Biden was "in constant communication with Israeli officials, as well as other partners and allies". Republicans in the House of Representatives, meanwhile, said they were drafting legislation to provide more aid to Israel and sanction Iran.What was in wave of Iranian attacks and how were they thwarted?For the first time ever , Iran has carried out strikes against Israeli territory .In the middle of Saturday night, air raid alerts went off in Israel, residents were urged to seek shelter while explosions were heard as air defences were activated.Interceptions lit up the night sky in several places across the country , while many drones and missiles were shot down by Israel's allies before they reached Israeli territory .At least nine countries were involved in the military escalation - with projectiles fired from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen and downed by Israel, the US, the UK and France as well as Jordan.

Here's what we know about the attack so far. ● LIVE UPDA TES: Follow the latest ● What is Israel's Iron Dome missile system?● Watch: Sirens activated as objects shot down from sky Attack involved drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles Iran launched more than 300 drones and missiles towards Israel, the Israeli military said on Sunday .The attack included 170 drones and 30 cruise missiles, none of which entered Israeli territory , and 110 ballistic missiles of which a small number reached Israel, military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a televised statement.The BBC has not independently verified those figures.The shortest distance from Iran to Israel is about 1,000km (620 miles) across Iraq, Syria and Jordan.Bombardment launched from several countries On Saturday night Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) said it had launched drones and missiles.Iraqi security sources told Reuters that projectiles were seen flying over Iraq in the direction of Israel.

The IRGC said ballistic missiles were fired almost an hour after the slower moving drones so that they would strike Israel at roughly the same time. The US defence department said US forces intercepted dozens of missiles and drones launched from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen.The Iran-backed Hezbollah group in Lebanon also said it had fired two barrages of rockets at an Israeli military base in the occupied Golan Heights, a plateau which Israel has annexed from Syria in a move not recognised by most of the international community .Israel and allies intercept majority of drones and missiles Some 99% of the incoming barrage was intercepted either outside Israeli airspace or over the country itself, Rear Adm Hagari said.They included all the drones and cruise missiles, which follow a flat trajectory , and most of the ballistic missiles, which are fired on an arcing trajectory that uses gravity to reach very high speeds.

US President Joe Biden said US forces "helped Israel take down nearly all" drones and missiles launched by Iran on Sunday . In a statement, he said the US had moved aircraft and warships to the region before the unprecedented attack.Operating from undisclosed bases in the region, US forces shot down a number of Iranian drones over southern Syria near the border with Jordan, security sources told Reuters.UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has confirmed that UK RAF Typhoon jets also shot down a number of Iranian attack drones.Mr Sunak said the Iranian attack was a "dangerous and unnecessary escalation which I've condemned in strongest terms".Jordan - which has a peace treaty with Israel but has been highly critical of the way it has carried out its war against the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza - also intercepted flying objects that entered its airspace to secure the safety of its citizens, a Jordanian cabinet statement said.

France helped to patrol airspace but it was unclear if they had shot down any drones or missiles, the Israeli military said. How many missiles got through and what damage did they cause?In Jerusalem BBC correspondents reported hearing sirens and seeing Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system in operation , which uses radar to track rockets and can differentiate between those that are likely to hit built-up areas and those that are not.Interceptor missiles are only fired at rockets expected to strike populated areas.A few of the ballistic missiles got through and struck Israeli territory , Rear Adm Hagari said.One of them "lightly hit" the Nevatim air force base in the Negev desert in southern Israel.Rear Adm Hagari said the base was "still functioning".Iran's official IRNA news agency said the attack had dealt "heavy blows" to the air base.A 10-year-old girl was severely injured by shrapnel, Rear Adm Hagari said.

The girl from a Bedouin Arab community near the southern town of Arad, was reported to have been injured after an Iranian drone was intercepted overhead. She was in intensive care.Jordan also said that some shrapnel had fallen on its territory "without causing any significant damage or any injuries to citizens".What happens now?Israel's Channel 12 TV cited an unnamed Israeli official as saying there would be a "significant response" to the attack.Israeli airspace has been reopened as has that of neighbouring countries, but Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the confrontation with Iran was "not over yet".Meanwhile Iran has warned Israel its response "will be much larger than tonight's military action if Israel retaliates against Iran", armed forces chief of staff Major General Mohammad Bagheri told state TV.He said US bases would also be attacked if the US took part in any Israeli retaliation.

IRGC commander Hossein Salami also said Tehran would retaliate against any Israeli attack on its interests, officials or citizens. The UN Security Council is due to meet at around 20:00 GMT to the latest crisis at Israel's request.Mr Biden said he would also convene leaders of the G7 group of wealthy nations on Sunday to coordinate a "united diplomatic response" to Iran's "brazen" attack.Iran has warned Israel that any "reckless" retaliation to its unprecedented aerial attack would receive a "much stronger response".More than 300 drones and missiles were launched at Israel by Iran overnight, following the 1 April Israeli strike on Iran's consulate in Syria.Israel said it and allies had intercepted 99% of the weapons.It marked Iran's first direct attack on Israel, with the two countries having waged a years-long shadow war.World leaders have urged restraint amid concerns about a major escalation in tensions in the Middle East.

Following the attack, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed "together we will win", but it is unclear how his country plans to respond. Last week, Israel's defence and foreign ministers warned that if Iran attacked Israel, Israel would strike back inside Iran.● LIVE UPDA TES: Follow the latest on the Iran-Israel attack ● EXPLAINED: Everything we know so far about wave of Iranian attacks ● LEARN: What is Israel's Iron Dome missile system?● UPDA TE ME: Israel on high alert after unprecedented Iranian attack ● WATCH: Explosions in sky over Jerusalem ● WATCH: Iran drone attack 'major escalation' - Israeli military An attack had been anticipated after the strike on the Damascus consulate killed seven Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) officers.In a statement reported by AFP, Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi said "if the Zionist regime [Israel] or its supporters demonstrate reckless behaviour , they will receive a decisive and much stronger response".

Iran's IRGC - the most powerful branch of its armed forces - said it had launched the attack "in retaliation against the Zionist regime's [Israel] repeated crimes, including the attack on the Iranian embassy's consulate in Damascus". Following the strikes the Iranian mission to the UN said "the matter can be deemed concluded".Iranian armed forces chief of staff Maj Gen Mohammad Bagheri told state TV the US had been warned - via Switzerland - that American backing of an Israeli retaliation would result in US regional bases being targeted.Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said he had told the US attacks against Israel will be "limited" and for self-defence, Reuters news agency reported.US President Joe Biden spoke to Mr Netanyahu following the launch of the Iranian attack and reaffirmed "America's ironclad commitment to the security of Israel".

He condemned the "unprecedented" attack on Israel and said the US had helped Israel and other allies to "take down nearly all" of the missiles and drones. Sirens sounded across Israel and loud explosions were heard over Jerusalem, with air defence systems shooting down objects over the city.The New York Times, citing Israeli intelligence sources, reported that the main targets appeared to be military instillations in the occupied Golan Heights.An Israeli military spokesman said around 360 munitions had been fired - including 170 explosive drones, 30 cruise missiles and 120 ballistic missiles - but Israel has said very little damage had been done.Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said some Iranian missiles had hit inside Israel, causing minor damage to a military base but no casualties.He said a 10-year-old Bedouin girl had been severely injured by shrapnel from falling debris in the southern Arad region.

World leaders will be considering their response to the major escalation in tensions between Israel and Iran, with many condemning the attack or warning of the dangers of escalation. Mr Biden said he would convene "my fellow G7 leaders to co-ordinate a united diplomatic response to Iran's brazen attack".The UN Security Council will also hold an emergency meeting later , its president Vanessa Frazier said.UN Secretary General António Guterres issued a statement saying he "strongly condemn[ed] the serious escalation represented by the large-scale attack launched on Israel" by Iran.He called for "an immediate cessation of these hostilities" and for all sides to exercise maximum restraint.UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called the strikes "reckless", while the European Union's foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said it was a "grave threat to regional security".

China's foreign ministry urged restraint, characterising it as "the latest spillover of the Gaza conflict", while Russia's foreign ministry expressed "extreme concern over another dangerous escalation". On Sunday , France recommended its citizens in Iran should temporarily leave the country due to the risk of military escalation.Speaking to crowds at the Vatican on Sunday , Pope Francis made a "heartfelt appeal for a halt to any action that could fuel a spiral of violence with the risk of dragging the Middle East into an even greater conflict".There have been increased tensions in the Middle East since the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, in which about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and more than 250 others were taken hostage.The subsequent Israeli military operation in Gaza has killed 33,729 people, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry .

Meanwhile Israel's spy agency Mossad said Hamas negotiators had rejected the most recent proposal put forward by mediators in peace talks. In a statement it said this proved Hamas' Gaza leader Yahya Sinwar "does not want a humanitarian deal and the return of the hostages" and was "continuing to exploit the tension with Iran".On Saturday , Hamas said it stood by its demand for a permanent ceasefire in the Gaza war, a complete Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, a return of Palestinians displaced by the fighting to their homes, and increased humanitarian aid to the territory .

Getting Help Every command within the CLI offers help. Some examples: scsctl help scsctl init dhcp help scsctl repo component add help Listing Components List the components registered with SCS: scsctl repo component list The result list displays active components (including the version that has been marked as active) as well as inactive components (in which no version has been marked as active).

Also, the former identity still exists in SCS, but will never be used (including any instance-specific setting or template overrides).There is a way to tell SCS to associate the former identity with the new instance ID, clearing out the old identity in the process.

The name of that cluster is governed by storage the name assigned to its group within SCS.Create the Cluster To create a group for Swarm Storage: scsctl storage group add "{cluster name}" Assigning a Storage Node to a SubclusterCaution At the time of writing, the CLI contains a bug when issuing this command to the API.Instead, use the curl command provided below to access the API directly. Each node forms a de-facto subcluster if no explicit subcluster assignments are made in Swarm Storage configuration.

The Swarm Storage component ( ) provides the setting as a free-form name that may be assigned to one or more nodes. storage node.subcluster The storage process looks at all names assigned to the different nodes and forms them into groups, which can then be used to determine how object replica distribution and protection are handled.The nodes may be grouped using subclusters in any way needed to achieve the desired replica/fail-over paradigm.

Update the subcluster for a storage node: scsctl storage config set -d --instance "{instance name/ID}" "node.subcluster={subcluster name}" Updating a Cluster Setting Update a cluster setting for Swarm Storage: scsctl storage config set -d "{setting name}={setting value}" Some specific examples: scsctl storage config set -d "policy.versioning=allowed" scsctl storage config set -d "policy.eCEncoding=4:2" Updating a Storage Node Setting Update a cluster setting for Swarm Storage: scsctl storage config set -d --instance "{instance name/ID}" "{setting name}={setting value}" Some specific examples: scsctl storage config set -d --instance "{instance name/ID}" "ec.protectionLevel=node" scsctl storage config set -d --instance "{instance name/ID}" "feeds.maxMem=500000" Resetting a Setting Removing a setting override means that the value for the setting is inherited from a higher scope.

Removing an instance-level override means that the value for the setting is obtained from either the group (if a group-level override has been set) or component level. Removing a group-level override has no influence on any existing instance-level overrides that may exist within that group.Instance Level Reset an instance-level override: scsctl {component} config unset --group "{group name}" --instance "{instance name/ID}" "{setting name}" Group Level Reset a group-level override: scsctl {component} config unset --group "{group name}" "{setting name}" Updating Network Settings Shared network settings, such as DNS information and NTP time sources, may be updated as the need arises.1.2.3.1.DNS Servers Update the list of DNS servers (specified as comma- or space-delimited list): scsctl network_boot config set -d "network.dnsServers={new DNS servers}" This also requires that the DHCP server be updated so the setting can be made available to booting Storage nodes.

scsctl init dhcp {reserved ranges} NTP Servers Update the list of NTP servers (specified as comma- or space-delimited list): scsctl platform config set -d "network.ntpServers={new NTP servers}" This also requires that the DHCP server be updated so the setting can be made available to booting Storage nodes. scsctl init dhcp {reserved ranges} Swarm (Internal) Network MTU Network MTU for the entire Swarm storage cluster is governed by the MTU set on the network interface of SCS.This value is put internal into DHCP configuration during the process, and served to all storage nodes on boot.init dhcp Update the MTU on the internal network interface.List the interface details on the SCS to ensure that the change is correct.Re-initialize DHCP to apply to changes to any future booting storage nodes: scsctl init dhcp {reserved ranges} Swarm (Internal) Network Gateway The network gateway for the entire Swarm storage cluster is governed by a setting available in SCS as of version 1.5.

The setting is provided by the component, and is called . By default, this setting points to the IP address of the network_boot network.gateway internal network interface of SCS, but may be overridden by normal means using the CLI.This value is put into DHCP configuration during the process, and served to all storage nodes on boot.init dhcp Update the setting.network.gatewayCaution It is important that this is done after the has been run.The wizard may modify the internal network interface init wizard definition and overwrite any MTU updates.If the wizard is run again, then MTU updates will need to be re-applied. Caution It is important that this is done AFTER the has been run.The wizard may modify the internal network interface init wizard definition and overwrite the internal interface IP address.If the wizard is run again, then any custom gateway definition may need to be re-applied. 1.2.

Network Devices and Priority Update the Setting Update the bonding mode setting in SCS: scsctl network_boot config set -d "kernel.bondingMode={new bonding mode}" Confirm the new setting value: scsctl network_boot config show -d "kernel.bondingMode" Apply the Setting to the PXE Boot System Restart the SCS services to apply this setting: systemctl restart swarm-platform Once all services have fully come back online (may take 2-3 minutes), storage nodes will receive the new bonding mode the next time they boot up.Support for kernel.sysctlFileUrl When a blob/static_file named SYSCTL is present for a node, a URL will be injected into node.cfg for kernel.sysctlFileUrl.

scsctl storage static_file set -d -f {path to local file on disk} SYSCTL If a different URL is used, then this blob must NOT be present. A different URL provided for the is allowed in the storage kernel.sysctlFileUrl component.scsctl storage config set -d “kernel.sysctlFileUrl={url to file}”Required Both of the below steps are required.If the setting is not properly applied to the PXE boot system, then storage nodes will not receive the updated bonding mode during the boot process. Only one approach but either option is fine based on customer environment requirements Updating Trusted Root Certificates When communicating with remote servers that use TLS, custom trusted root (CA) certificates may be specified.These certificates must be PEM-formatted, with all newlines replaced with a literal .

For example:\n line1 line2 …would become: line1\nline2 Once the certificate string is properly formatted (denoted as in the example below), apply it to SCS: CERT_STRING scsctl platform config set -d 'organization.certificates=CERT_STRING' Updating Client-Facing IP Address Best practice for SCS is to use a static IP address for the interface that will be receiving client requests. If that IP address changes, SCS may have issues starting up under certain circumstances.To resolve this, run the following commands on the SCS server: scsctl init config_update --external-interface {interface name} (to obtain a list of interfaces, use ip addr )show scsctl init wizard --build-platform-pod scsctl init config_update --finalize Administrative Credentials The SCS server maintains an administrator user that has full rights within the Swarm site.This user also serves as the administrative user within the Swarm Storage management API.

Credentials may be updated at any time, and updates are pushed to the Storage cluster to guarantee the two use the same credentials. Setting the Administrative User Name Update the administrative user name: scsctl platform config set -d "admin.userName={new user name}"Required Logging into the CLI is required to perform these operations if administrative credentials have already been set within SCS.The CLI credentials need to be updated once either the user name or password has changed. Important When updating the user name, the entire storage cluster be rebooted!must  Setting the Administrative Password Update the administrative password: scsctl platform config set -d "admin.password={new password}" Updating CLI Credentials The CLI requires knowing the administrative credentials to perform operations against the SCS server.

To set these credentials: scsctl auth login --user "{administrative user name}" The CLI then securely prompts for the administrative password and proceeds with authentication. Upgrading Swarm Storage Obtain the component bundle for the desired version from to upgrade the Swarm Storage software of a running DataCore Downloads cluster.Transfer the bundle to the SCS server and run the following commands to register it with SCS.Replace with the version being installed: new-version unzip Swarm-new-version.zip Navigate to the Storage directory and tun the following: cd Swarm-new-version/Storage/ scsctl repo component add -f swarm-scs-storage-new-version.tgz Verify the the new version is present in the list of available versions: scsctl storage software list old-version (old-version) (active) new-version (new-version) It has been successfully registered if the new version is in the list.It is not used for booting nodes and the current active version is used.

Mark it as active to complete the upgrade:Warning SCS may need to be upgraded before Swarm Storage. Verify the Swarm Storage version and SCS version are compatible before upgrading Swarm Storage.See for more details.Upgrading to the Latest SCS Version Important It should be automatically marked as active if this is the first time Swarm Storage software has been registered with SCS.The following step may be skipped otherwise proceed with activation if so. scsctl storage software activate "new-version (new-version)" activated Verify activation if desired: scsctl storage software list old-version (old-version) new-version (new-version) (active) Removing an Installed Version of Swarm Storage The following version texts are examples only.Verify the list of installed versions, and note which version is currently marked as active.

scsctl storage software list 14.0.1 (14.0.1) (active) 14.1.2 (14.1.2) To mark another version as active: scsctl storage software activate "14.1.2 (14.1.2)" activated Verify activation if desired: scsctl storage software list 14.0.1 (14.0.1) 14.1.2 (14.1.2) (active) Remove the desired version, using the entire version string:Caution Activating a version means that any nodes that reboot use the binaries for the new version. Do not complete this step until ready to proceed with the upgrade. Info This removes all software, published setting defaults, and configuration files associated with a of Swarm storage specific version software.

The software binaries, settings, and configuration files for other installed versions (and other installed components) remain unaffected by this action. Important If the version to be removed is currently the active version, it is strongly recommended that another version (if available) be marked active prior to removing the desired version. scsctl repo component delete storage "14.0.1 (14.0.1)" removed Verify removal if desired: scsctl storage software list 14.1.2 (14.1.2) (active) Backing Up SCS SCS allows a full backup of all components, configurations, settings overrides, and binaries for support and maintenance purposes. The CLI must be logged in since this backup includes values for settings marked as “secure”.

Full Backup Obtain a full backup of all data: scsctl backup create --output "{path to output backup file}" Lightweight Backup Obtain a “lightweight” backup that excludes repo data (binaries, etc.): scsctl backup create --no-repo --output "{path to output backup file}" Backup Restore Perform backup restore of all data: scsctl backup restore "{path to output backup file}"Important If the version being removed is the only installed version, or if another version cannot be activated for any reason, then the -- flag will need to be added to the command in order to remove the version.force

Object Locking Content Portal Object Locking Essentials Retention Periods Retention Modes Legal Hold Prerequisites Enabling Object Locking within a Bucket Applying Retention Locking Inheriting Default Retention Setting Up Retention on a New Object Modifying Retention on an Existing Object Version Applying Legal Hold Setting Up Legal Hold During Upload Modifying Legal Hold on an Existing Object Version Object Locking Essentials Object Locking prevents object versions from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely.It is applied to an object version to meet regulatory requirements that require WORM storage or to add another protection layer against object changes and deletion.There is a strong connection between Object Locking and Versioning.Object Locking does not lock objects, but individual .

object versions Therefore, a user can create new object versions even though the object is locked, but it is impossible to delete or change any locked version of the object. There are two types of Object Locking: Retention -Specifies a fixed period (“retention period”) during which the object version remains locked.During this retention period, the object is WORM-protected and cannot be overwritten or deleted.After the period expires, the lock goes away automatically from the object.Legal hold - Keeps the object locked until the legal hold is explicitly removed.These two types of object locking are orthogonal, independent of each other, and can be used simultaneously.Retention Periods A locks an object version for a fixed amount of time.Until that fixed amount of time has expired, one cannot delete or retention period change the object version.There are three different ways to set a retention period on an object version: Newly created objects can inherit a configured on the bucket.

default retention period Explicitly set a retention period when creating a new object. This overrides the default retention period configured on the bucket if present.Explicitly set a retention period on an existing object version.A bucket's default retention period specifies the duration in days or years, for which, every object version placed in the bucket is locked.While placing an object in the bucket, the Gateway calculates a retention period for the object version by adding the specified duration to the object version's creation timestamp.An already set retention period can always be .Submit a new lock request for the object version with a retention period longer extended than the current period.The Gateway replaces the existing retention period with the new, longer period.Any user with permission to place an object retention period can extend a retention period.1.2.3.4.5.6.

Retention Modes There are two that impact what can be done with objects under retention: retention modes In mode, some users can be granted permission to shorten or remove a retention period if necessary. governance In mode, any user including the admin user, cannot overwrite or delete a protected object version.When an object is compliance locked in the compliance mode, the retention mode cannot be changed, and the retention period cannot be shortened.The default retention mode and retention period can be set independently at the bucket level.The retention mode always applies to the individual objects carrying it, not to the bucket or cluster as a whole.Legal Hold A legal hold prevents an object version from being overwritten or deleted like a retention period.A legal hold does not have an associated retention period and remains in effect until removed.Legal holds are independent of retention periods and retention modes.

As long as the bucket contains an object that has Object Locking enabled, the user can place and remove legal holds regardless of whether the specified object version has a retention period set or not. Placing a legal hold on an object version does not affect the retention mode or retention period for that object version.Prerequisites Object Locking must be enabled within the cluster.At least one bucket must be available, and that bucket must have versioning enabled.Enabling Object Locking within a Bucket Refer to the following steps to apply Object Locking to an existing bucket: Search and select the target bucket name.Click .Settings > Properties Select the checkbox for .Enable Object Locking Select the appropriate default mode, either or , to apply a default retention mode.

Governance Compliance Enter the default duration in days or years to apply a default retention duration.Important A legal hold cannot be applied as a default at the bucket level. Important The bucket must have versioning enabled. 6. 1.2.3.4.5.Click .Save The bucket has Object Locking enabled once the configurations are saved.Any objects written to that bucket have the defined duration with the selected mode automatically applied, unless different values are provided at the time of write.The lock icon next to the bucket name represents that the bucket has Object Locking enabled.Retention locking defaults are defined if the icon is green.Note Object Locking cannot be disabled once enabled for a bucket.The retention mode and duration can be updated.Applying Retention Locking A user can apply retention either via defaults set at the level or any object versions of that bucket.

There are three ways to apply bucket retention on an object version: Create an object under the bucket that has Object Locking enabled. This newly created object inherits the default retention mode and period configured on the bucket.Explicitly set a retention period when creating a new object.This overrides the default retention period configured on the bucket if present.Explicitly set a retention period on an existing object version.Inheriting Default Retention Before inheriting the default retention period of a bucket, verify the default retention mode and retention period under the Bucket’s .To learn more about uploading through Content UI, see .Settings > Properties Uploading Files New object versions can inherit the default retention configuration of the buckets by referring to the following steps: Navigate to the upload page for the target bucket in Content UI.The upload settings for Object Locking are located under .

The defaults set at the bucket level are automatically Retention Time applied. The upload does not proceed until all required values are present if either default is missing.A legal Hold can also be applied during the upload.This setting is independent of the retention locking settings and is not subject to any bucket-level defaults.Adding a file name prefix and metadata for the object version is optional.Click .Start UploadInfo Each object within a given bucket can have unique and independent retention policies applied to them. Info When uploading an object via Content UI, any defaults defined at the bucket level are visible during the upload process.If either the mode or duration is missing, the upload process does not proceed until the values are provided for that specific upload. 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.1.2.3.4.5.6.7.The new object version is added to the bucket with the retention configuration applied.

A lock icon is displayed next to the object version name to represent that the object version is locked. Click the locked object version to view the Object Locking details.Setting Up Retention on a New Object If the bucket has Object Locking enabled but does not have any prior default retention configured, a retention policy can explicitly be set on a new object during its creation.To learn more about uploading through Content UI, see .Uploading Files Navigate to the upload page for the target bucket in Content UI.The upload settings for Object Locking are located under .As there are no defaults at the bucket level, no policy is Retention Time automatically applied.An object lock policy is optional; no policy needs to be defined.If any values are specified, then the upload does not proceed until all required values are present.Select an Object Locking mode which is either or .Governance Compliance Enter the Object Locking duration in either days or years.

A legal hold can also be applied during the upload. This setting is independent of the retention locking settings and is not subject to any bucket-level defaults.Adding a file name prefix and metadata for the object version is optional.Click .Start Upload The new object version is added to the bucket with the retention configuration applied.A lock icon is displayed next to the object version name to represent that the object version is locked.Click the object version to view its details.Modifying Retention on an Existing Object Version The user can apply a retention lock on an object version as long as the bucket has Object Locking enabled if an existing object version does not have Object Locking enabled.This same process is used to update Object Locking on an existing object version.Refer to the following steps to apply retention on an existing object: Locate the object within the bucket.Select the object and optionally choose a specific version to update.

website There are two main sections in this document: Swarm deployment using the OVF VM bundle package. Deploying Swarm from scratch.The present document is based on a traditional deployment of Swarm, where the management and access layer run virtualized in one or more VMware ESXi hosts, while the storage nodes are physical x86-64 machines that will hold the data.See the below diagram.Note The process described in this document covers a standard and generic deployment of Swarm, focused on small installations and test environments for Proof-of-Concept/Proof-of-Value purposes.As every single use case may be different, we recommend working with DataCore partners and DataCore Solutions Architects to address any specific configuration requirements or customization needed.Swarm 15.3 VM Bundle Deployment Page 2 of 28 © 2021 DataCore Software Corporation.All Rights Reserved.

Below are the software components of the entire Swarm stack, their functions, and count recommendations for durability and availability purposes: Swarm Storage Nodes Swarm is an in-purpose built on-premises object storage solution. It runs on standard physical x86-64 servers providing a single pool of resources, supporting billions of objects/files in the same cluster and extending its capabilities to multiple sites (data replication).Swarm will leverage all hardware resources the node (server where it runs) provides: CPU, RAM, network, and any direct-attached disk drives.Minimum recommended storage nodes count: Four (4).Platform Server - Swarm Cluster Services (SCS) The SCS software provides Swarm cluster configuration and boot services as well as log aggregation and Swarm version management.The SCS is not in the data path, but it does require access to the same layer 2 network as the Swarm storage nodes.Minimum recommended SCS count: One (1).

Elasticsearch Provides listing and search capabilities based on object name and object metadata. Minimum recommended Elasticsearch VM count for production environments: Three (3).For functional Proof-of-Concepts, one (1) instance should suffice.Best Practice Create a snapshot or clone the VM once its configuration is completed.Only one SCS instance can be online.Swarm 15.3 VM Bundle Deployment Page 3 of 28 © 2021 DataCore Software Corporation.All Rights Reserved.DataCore, the DataCore logo, SANsymphony, vFilO and Swarm are trademarks or registered trademarks of DataCore Software Corporation.All other products, services and company names mentioned herein may be trademarks of their respective owners.No part of this material may be reproduced, transmitted, or transcribed without the written consent of DataCore.

| www.datacore.comContent Gateway The Content Gateway provides S3 and HTTP access as well as a Content Portal (web interface) that users and administrators can leverage to create buckets, upload data, use collections to perform searches (based on metadata), and many more. Hence, the Content Gateway is in the data path.Content Gateway also enforces multitenancy features such as user authentication against LDAP, Active Directory or Single-Sign-on (SAML), permissions, quotas, and so on.Minimum recommended Content Gateway count for production environments: Two (2).For functional Proof-of-Concepts, one (1) instance should suffice.Telemetry (Optional) Prometheus integration and Grafana dashboards.Minimum recommended Telemetry count: Usually one (1), but there could be as many as needed.Load Balancers (Optional) To balance the client load across all the Content Gateway instances, an HTTP Load Balancer in front of the Content Gateways can be leveraged.

This load balancer can be a software solution such as HAProxy, NGINX, or others. Also, it could be a hardware-based, appliance one.Important As Content Gateway is in the data path, at least two instances should be up and running at all times.A load balance mechanism such an HTTP Load Balancer is recommended to distribute requests across all the Content Gateway instances.Alternatively, DNS-RR can be used.Optional This section is optional.Optional This section is optional.Note The DMZ network, load balancers, and public network items are outside the DataCore offering.Swarm 15.3 VM Bundle Deployment Page 4 of 28 © 2021 DataCore Software Corporation.All Rights Reserved.DataCore, the DataCore logo, SANsymphony, vFilO and Swarm are trademarks or registered trademarks of DataCore Software Corporation.All other products, services and company names mentioned herein may be trademarks of their respective owners.

No part of this material may be reproduced, transmitted, or transcribed without the written consent of DataCore. | www.datacore.comNetworking Requirements and Recommendations Swarm utilizes a dual networking configuration, where there is a Storage (Backend) network and a Service (Frontend) one.As per the diagram above, the Swarm storage nodes are only connected to the Backend network, while the management and access layer components have presence in both (dual-homed).Hence, this Backend/storage network must be configured in VMware ESXi as well.The Backend network could be just a VLAN in the existent switching environment.However, this VLAN/network has to be dedicated exclusively to Swarm and it is usually isolated from the rest of the network environment.At any rate, no other system outside the Swarm stack should be connected to it.The switch ports used by the Swarm storage nodes must be in access mode, as the Swarm nodes cannot tag VLAN traffic.

Also, ‘port fast’ should be enabled to facilitate the PXE boot process (see below). The Swarm storage nodes will PXE boot (boot over the network) from the SCS virtual machine that holds the image of the Operating System the nodes will use, as well as the cluster configuration.As part of the PXE boot process, the nodes will ask for an IP address via DHCP.The SCS VM will act as that DHCP server in the storage/backend network, no other DHCP server must be present in the Backend network segment.To maximize availability, network failover (active-backup) configurations are encouraged, for both the Swarm storage and the virtualized management and access layer.Environment Prerequisites The following table illustrates the requirements for a typical Swarm deployment.

In order to avoid collisions with other Swarm services, we can reserve a number of IP addresses at the beginning or the end of the range, so SCS will not assign those IP addresses to the nodes. In order to do this, run: scsctl init dhcp --dhcp-reserve-lower=50 --dhcp-reserve-upper=10 adjusting the values to whatever makes sense in the backend network.I.e., in a /24 network, the above will use from to to PXE boot and assign IP addresses to the Swarm storage .51 .244 nodes.If the physical servers have SSD/NVMe or smaller drives that are not interesting for Swarm, they can be excluded running: scsctl storage config set -d ​​"disk.minGB=4096" As an example, the above command will exclude any drive that is smaller than 4TB.Unzip and add the license key.

This key should be a plain text file: scsctl license add -f license.txt It is recommended to enable Swarm node stats for the Telemetry VM (Prometheus/Grafana), in order to do this, run: scsctl storage config set -d "metrics.enableNodeExporter=true" scsctl storage config set -d "metrics.nodeExporterFrequency=120" If the Swarm storage nodes use an Intel Skylake based CPU or similar, run the following: scsctl network_boot config set kernel.extraArgs=clocksource.max_cswd_read_retries=50 -d systemctl restart swarm-platform For more information, see Intel Skylake/Cascade Lake CPU Performance Issue Finally, create a backup of the SCS configuration. Run: scsctl backup -o backup-config -<date> At this point, SCS has been configured and it is ready to PXE boot Swarm storage nodes.Note The above key name and value are just examples.Swarm 15.3 VM Bundle Deployment Page 11 of 28 © 2021 DataCore Software Corporation.All Rights Reserved.

Set the time zone according to your local clock: timedatectl set-timezone <timezone> hwclock --systohc Point to the IP address of the SCS VM over the storage/private network.

/etc/chrony.d/chrony.conf Important Before doing this, deploy the Swarm Search VM template (SwarmSearch1.ovf). Note The Operating System (CentOS 7.9) and the Swarm software is pre-installed.It has two virtual interfaces, one for the backend network and another for the frontend one.The latter is disconnected by default as it's not strictly required.Important Make sure that the first virtual network card of the VM is connected to the Backend network.Note All available time zones can be listed with the command: timedatectl list-timezones Swarm 15.3 VM Bundle Deployment Page 12 of 28 © 2021 DataCore Software Corporation.All Rights Reserved.DataCore, the DataCore logo, SANsymphony, vFilO and Swarm are trademarks or registered trademarks of DataCore Software Corporation.All other products, services and company names mentioned herein may be trademarks of their respective owners.No part of this material may be reproduced, transmitted, or transcribed without the written consent of DataCore.

Essentially, this is a non-RAID configuration where all the disk drives are presented to the operating system individually. It is also called , , , IT mode HBA mode pass thru or .non-RAID The network card port connected to the Backend VLAN/network must be enabled for PXE booting, no other port should be PXE-boot enabled.Moreover, there should not be any other port connected to any other network, with the exception of the dedicated port for out of band management (OOB, IPMI, BMC) Once these has been verified, the PXE boot process can begin.Start with a single node, making sure it boots properly.Continue with the rest.A successful Swarm storage node boot looks like this on the screen / IPMI console of the server: Swarm version, IP address of the node, and “Storage Processes: RUNNING ” should appear on the screen.Content Gateway The final step to have everything needed to have a functional Swarm cluster is to get Content Gateway up and running.

These steps are described in detail across different sections in the Swarm documentation. The following links provide a good starting point to deploy Swarm from the beginning.Also, the VM bundle can be used as a guide to configure a new deployment from scratch.Planning and Storage Nodes Prerequisites Deployment Planning Hardware Requirements for Storage SCS Network Planning Setup RHEL/CentOS for SCS SCS Installation Run the Swarm Cluster Services (SCS) Initialization Wizard Add the Swarm Storage Component Finalize Swarm Configuration Settings Configure DHCP Install Swarm License Power on the Swarm Storage Nodes Elasticsearch Hardware Requirements for Elasticsearch Preparing the Search Cluster Installing Elasticsearch Configuring Elasticsearch Setup Elasticsearch Cluster Managing Feeds Content Gateway Gateway Requirements Gateway Installation Gateway Configuration Gateway Verification Swarm 15.3 VM Bundle Deployment Page 28 of 28 © 2021 DataCore Software Corporation.

The present document is based on a traditional deployment of Swarm, where the management and access layer run virtualized in one or more VMware ESXi hosts, while the storage nodes are physical x86-64 machines that will hold the data. See the below diagram.Swarm Components The Swarm stack utilizes several components grouped in two different layers: Storage Layer: Comprised by the Swarm storage nodes which hold the information and take care of data protection.Note The process described in this document covers a standard and generic deployment of Swarm, focused on small installations and test environments for Proof-of-Concept/Proof-of-Value purposes.As every single use case may be different, we recommend working with DataCore partners and DataCore Solutions Architects to address any specific configuration requirements or customization needed.Swarm 16.0 VM Bundle Deployment for Rocky Linux 8 Page 2 of 32 © 2021 DataCore Software Corporation.All Rights Reserved.

It runs on standard physical x86-64 servers providing a single pool of resources, supporting billions of objects/files in the same cluster and extending its capabilities to multiple sites (data replication). Swarm will leverage all hardware resources the node (server where it runs) provides: CPU, RAM, network, and any direct-attached disk drives.Minimum recommended storage nodes count: Four (4).Platform Server - Swarm Cluster Services (SCS) The SCS software provides Swarm cluster configuration and boot services as well as log aggregation and Swarm version management.The SCS is not in the data path, but it does require access to the same layer 2 network as the Swarm storage nodes.Minimum recommended SCS count is one.Elasticsearch Provides listing and search capabilities based on object name and object metadata.Minimum recommended Elasticsearch VM count for production environments is three.For functional Proof-of-Concepts, one instance should suffice.

Content Gateway The Content Gateway provides S3 and HTTP access as well as a Content Portal (web interface) that users and administrators can leverage to create buckets, upload data, use collections to perform searches (based on metadata), and many more. Hence, the Content Gateway is in the data path.Content Gateway also enforces multitenancy features such as user authentication against LDAP, Active Directory or Single-Sign-on (SAML), permissions, quotas, and so on.Minimum recommended Content Gateway count for production environments is two.Best Practice Create a snapshot or clone the VM once its configuration is completed.Only one SCS instance can be online.Swarm 16.0 VM Bundle Deployment for Rocky Linux 8 Page 3 of 32 © 2021 DataCore Software Corporation.All Rights Reserved.DataCore, the DataCore logo, SANsymphony, vFilO and Swarm are trademarks or registered trademarks of DataCore Software Corporation.

No part of this material may be reproduced, transmitted, or transcribed without the written consent of DataCore.| www.datacore.comFor functional Proof-of-Concepts, one instance should suffice.Telemetry (Optional) Prometheus integration and Grafana dashboards.Minimum recommended Telemetry count is often one, but there could be as many as needed.Load Balancers (Optional) To balance the client load across all the Content Gateway instances, an HTTP Load Balancer in front of the Content Gateways can be leveraged.This load balancer can be a software solution such as HAProxy, NGINX, or others.Also, it could be a hardware-based, appliance one.Networking Requirements and Recommendations Swarm utilizes a dual networking configuration, where there is a Storage (Backend) network and a Service (Frontend) one.

As per the diagram above, the Swarm storage nodes are only connected to the Backend network, while the management and access layer components have presence in both (dual-homed). Hence, this Backend/storage network must be configured in VMware ESXi as well.The Backend network could be just a VLAN in the existent switching environment.However, this VLAN/network has to be dedicated exclusively to Swarm and it is usually isolated from the rest of the network environment.At any rate, no other system outside the Swarm stack should be connected to it.The switch ports used by the Swarm storage nodes must be in access mode, as the Swarm nodes cannot tag VLAN traffic.Also, ‘port fast’ should be enabled to facilitate the PXE boot process (see below).Important As Content Gateway is in the data path, at least two instances should be up and running at all times.A load balance mechanism such an HTTP Load Balancer is recommended to distribute requests across all the Content Gateway instances.

Alternatively, DNS-RR can be used. Note The DMZ network, load balancers, and public network items are outside the DataCore offering.Swarm 16.0 VM Bundle Deployment for Rocky Linux 8 Page 4 of 32 © 2021 DataCore Software Corporation.All Rights Reserved.DataCore, the DataCore logo, SANsymphony, vFilO and Swarm are trademarks or registered trademarks of DataCore Software Corporation.All other products, services and company names mentioned herein may be trademarks of their respective owners.No part of this material may be reproduced, transmitted, or transcribed without the written consent of DataCore.

Multicast is no longer required with Swarm 15, but enabling it still remains a best practice.

The Swarm storage nodes will PXE boot (boot over the network) from the SCS virtual machine that holds the image of the Operating System the nodes will use, as well as the cluster configuration. As part of the PXE boot process, the nodes will ask for an IP address via DHCP.The SCS VM will act as that DHCP server in the storage /backend network, no other DHCP server must be present in the Backend network segment.To maximize availability, network failover (active-backup) configurations are encouraged, for both the Swarm storage and the virtualized management and access layer.Swarm 16.0 VM Bundle Deployment for Rocky Linux 8 Page 5 of 32 © 2021 DataCore Software Corporation.All Rights Reserved.DataCore, the DataCore logo, SANsymphony, vFilO and Swarm are trademarks or registered trademarks of DataCore Software Corporation.All other products, services and company names mentioned herein may be trademarks of their respective owners.

As stated in the first chapter of this guide, for testing and Proof-of-Concept scenarios, usually a single Elasticsearch VM is sufficient. However, for production environments at least three Elasticsearch VMs must be deployed.Important Before doing this, deploy the Swarm Search VM template (SwarmSearch1.ovf).Note The Operating System (Rocky Linux 8.9) and the Swarm software is pre-installed.It has two virtual interfaces, one for the backend network and another for the frontend one.The latter is disconnected by default as it's not strictly required.Verify that the first virtual network card of the VM is connected to the network.backend Swarm 16.0 VM Bundle Deployment for Rocky Linux 8 Page 13 of 32 © 2021 DataCore Software Corporation.All Rights Reserved.DataCore, the DataCore logo, SANsymphony, vFilO and Swarm are trademarks or registered trademarks of DataCore Software Corporation.

With the above steps, only one Elasticsearch VM will be provisioned.The status will appear in “Yellow” the moment there is any data in Elasticsearch as there is no redundancy.This configuration is enough for Proof-of-Concept or Proof-of-Value scenarios.However, for production environments, the recommendation is to have at least three Elasticsearch VMs up and running forming a cluster by themselves.The steps to deploy a full Elasticsearch cluster are explained below: Deploy the template two more times.SwarmSearch1.ovf Update the static IP address for the backend adapter .ens192 Update of the two new VMs, e.g., “swarmsearch2”, “swarmsearch3”./etc/hostname Stop the service and delete the pre-generated data: elasticsearch Optional To assign an IP address on the Frontend network/VLAN, change the IP configuration and verify the connection information for the network.
